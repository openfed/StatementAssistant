## How to add a locale?

To add a locale you need to launch the following command:

`yarn add-locale it`

This will for example add the italian locale. After that we need to extract the locale to create the source:

`yarn extract --clean`

You'll have to edit `src\datas\atoms.js` to add your locale to the language swicher :

```js
default: ["nl", "fr", "de", "en", "it"],
```

And when you want to build the app don't forget to compile the locales before compiling the app: `yarn compile`

## How to modify/translate a locale?

In `src\locales` you've all of the locale added to the project. For example if you want to edit the italian you need to edit :
`src\locales\it\messages.po`

You can modify this file via a PO file editor. There's plenty of softwares for that even online. Example :

- https://localise.biz/free/poeditor
- https://poedit.net

### Remark for Select

When we've to translate a text based on a variable we need to do what we call a Select. The Select'll select the right text to display according to the variable. But it can be a bit confusing for a non-technical person to know what to translate and what not to translate. And as a picture is worth a thousand words :

What is highlighted must be translated the rest need to stay in english.
